The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, applying `!important` to `.child` overrides the specificity of `.parent .child`, but the `!important` declaration on `.child` is still less specific than `.parent .child`, leading to unexpected results.  The order in which the styles are defined and their specificity often impact the final style more than `!important` in some cases.
