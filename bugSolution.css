The following corrected CSS code demonstrates a solution by re-arranging specificity and removing unnecessary `!important`:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}
```

Alternatively, to maintain the `!important` in `.child` one would need a more specific selector on `.parent .child` to override it such as `
.parent .child { color: green !important; }`. However this approach is generally less preferred as it can create maintenance problems in larger codebases.
